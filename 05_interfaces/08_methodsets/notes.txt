 method sets - the set of methods which are attached to a type OR which a a type has

 receivers  - what defines the method
   what type we can have
     value receiver
       pointer value AND/OR value type can use that receiver
       Can attach a method to a value type OR pointer type  - by using a value receiver
     pointer receiver

   which types can use receivers


The stack
  A stack of functions
  A layer of functions i.e. Func A call Func B which Calls Func C
  As C executes - comes off the stack
  As B executes - comes off the stack
  Dynamically growing stack

The heap
  When a variable goes off the stack it escapes to the heap

Conclusion: When you have a value it may not have an address - cannot take the address of a variable if it is never on the stack or the heap
