Go does not have any exceptions why?
  Try, catch, block in other program languages clunky - reduces readability
  Go has panic & recover instead!
  Go's approach to concurrency - Communicating Sequential Processes
  Reduce the "scope" of errors - report your errors as close to as they occur

Lint :
  Unix utility that flags likely bugs
  Prints out style mistakes - used internally in google

./... -> This current directory and all the current files recursively do it

ALWAYS - in production code have error checking


Use func init - runs before func main

Error values are not special - they are just like any other value - have the entire language at your disposal
  What is a value ? - i..e x = 3, value = 3 & type = int, values of TYPE error
