Do concurrency with go -routines

Concurrency = the composition of indepently executing processes
  DEALING with lots of things at once
  Can concurrently speak AND drink coffee - speak, drink, drink, speak speak
  Continously switching on processes

Parallelism = the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations \
  DOING lots of things at once.
  CANNOT speak AND drink coffee in parallel - mut do one or the other at any ONE specific moment
  Working simultaneously on all processes - i.e. mutiple cores
